Aesthetic, bold typography and modern layout.

A short, friendly bio emphasizing skills in building user-centric interfaces and analyzing data to inform design decisions.

Soft skills like collaboration, problem-solving, and storytelling.

Each project should have a visual thumbnail, title, short summary, tech stack badges, and "View Details" button.

Example projects to include:
